**Fusion** is a Minecraft mod (for **1.12.2** exclusively) that is designed as a tool set for far superior adventure maps than possible with vanilla. It's also possible to use Mappet for scripted roleplays, and, to some extent, in Minecraft machinimas.
**Fusion is a fork for [Mappet](https://github.com/mchorse/mappet) by McHorse**

## Install

Install [Minecraft Forge](http://files.minecraftforge.net/), download the latest stable version of jar file for available Minecraft version. Also install following mods: [McLib](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/mchorses-mclib), [Metamorph](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/metamorph), and [Blockbuster](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/blockbuster). Put it in minecraft's `mods` folder, and launch the game.

After that, Fusion mod should be installed and will appear in Minecraft's mods menu. If Fusion didn't appear in the mods menu, then something went wrong.
